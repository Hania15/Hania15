### Hi there 👋

**`Hania15 BI Developer/Data Analyst`**

I'm an BI Developer/Data Analyst working everyday step by step to be really good at it. Most of the projects which are on my github are done from the ground up, but actually general part of those projects are some kind of youtube excersises to gain more skills and get more ease with code tasks. I hope that one day it will be as natural to me as making breakfast.🍳🥓(Yeah, you are right I'm a food lover!)

 <summary><h3>👩‍💻 My Journey! </h3></summary>


Ok, so from the very beginning... 😅 When I was a little girl, I was fascinated by everything related to computers. It all started with my dad, who used to fix people's computers in the evenings and as almost every kid, I was curious about it. As I grew older, again -> like most people my age, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, and partly influenced by others, I leaned towards a career in finance. However, there was always something pulling me towards numbers, but as it turned out, not in that particular finance field. There was still something drawing me to IT.

And so, I found myself in my first IT company, working in a support role. It was a little bit closer to what I wanted, but still far away from my comfort zone. While exploring my options, I came across Power BI, and it turned out to be a bullseye! I decided to pursue a master's degree in IT-related studies and devoted my free time to learning more about it. That's a time when a person from a different team noticed my efforts and invited me for an interview. The stars aligned, and I became a Junior BI developer. From that moment on, I felt like anything related to DATA was my true path, and ever since, I've been giving my all to develop in this field.
